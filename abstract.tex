    In recent years the area of machine learning has gained a lot of ground in a broad range of areas.
    A particularly interesting problem pertaining to machine learning is how we can develop useful AIs
    in a more hands off fashion.
    This problem is addressed by a machine learning paradigm named reinforcement learning.
    Reinforcement learning allows us to set up an agent in an environment after which the agent can
    explore the environment and begin to learn which actions that it should take in the
    different scenarios it can find itself in.
    This avenue of machine learning is suited to a broad range of problems but in this project we
    will explore the possibility of applying it to the game of texas hold'em.
