\chapter{Introduction (10)}
\label{ch:intro}
In this section I will introduce the subject area of this Final year Project (FYP).
I will then go on to give an overview of the report, establish some goals for the project along with some of
the motivations for choosing this subject area.


\section{Overview (3) w5}\label{sec:overview}
Since the inception of machine learning, games have been a key problem area that has seen a lot of focus from
top academics.
Furthermore, the development of some machine learning strategies that can be applied to games has also lead to these
strategies being applied in many different domains, many of which being very beneficial in practice.

\section{Objectives (2) w4}\label{sec:objectives}
\subsection{Primary Objectives}\label{subsec:primaryObjectives}
\subsubsection{Leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning to Develop a Poker Playing Agent}
In the past, methods such as counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) have been used to develop agents that can
play no-limit texas hold'em to a superhuman level.
There have also been attempts to solve the limit version of the game using reinforcement learning (RL).
Throughout the course of this project I will be using an iterative approach to solving the problem.
As such the first agent that I will develop will seek to tackle a simplified version of hold'em.
Specifically I will be attempting to recreate the results outlined in\cite{dahl2001reinforcement}.
This will be my initial objective with potential future iterations expanding upon this work to tackle a more complete
version of the game.

\subsubsection{Experiment with Different Reinforcement Learning Methodologies}
Although all RL algorithms share certain core properties, there are a number of distinct approaches that we can take.
In this project we will attempt to determine, through statistical analysis, which approach yields the most favourable results.

\subsubsection{Develop a Web Interface For Users to Play Against the Agent}
The focus of this report will largely be research.
However it is also my goal to create a product that will be fun and useful for the general public.
As such another objective will be to create a website that will allow users to play heads-up against the final product.


\subsubsection{Utilise Various Techniques to Prove the Efficacy of the AI Agent Produced}
In order to prove the poker playing agent's ability I hope to leverage a number of techniques.
As the first version of the poker playing agent will be based on\cite{dahl2001reinforcement} I will be using similar
techniques as outlined in the paper to test the agent.
This means that I will test the agent against a random player, a balanced player and an aggressive player.
The random player will play in a completely random manner, the balanced player will play according to the minimax
algorithm and finally the aggressive player will be a variation of the balanced player that folds less regularly.

In my research thus far a prominent method of testing poker agents is to utilise previously established agents as
a benchmark.
This involves playing a number of games against these agents and recording the results in terms of winnings.
An example of this is\cite{heinrich2016deep} that utilised some of the best current poker agents
as established by the Annual Computer Poker Competition (ACPC).

\subsection{Secondary Objectives}\label{subsec:secondaryObjectives}
\subsubsection{Understanding Reinforcement Learning}
As this project is very specific and academic, one of the larger challenges will be to gain a strong knowledge of the domain.
This means learning the history of RL, the types of problems that it has been used to solve and the specific details of
different RL algorithms.

\subsubsection{Understand the Existing Literature on Artificial Intelligence and Imperfect Information Games}
A successful project will require a high degree of knowledge from the broader domain of RL. However, it is also the case
that I must become closely familiar with the existing academic literature in the area of RL with respect to imperfect
information games.
This will allow me to avoid taking approaches that have previously shown to fail and also allow me to contribute to
the existing literature without simply replicating what has already been done.
