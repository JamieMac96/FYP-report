% Preamble
\section*{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:acknowledgements}

First I would like to thank my FYP supervisor, Mr. J.J Collins for his
constant support, feedback, and guidance on the project.
I came to him with the broad aim of applying reinforcement learning to poker and through his
expertise and engagement, he was able to help me find a path for the project
that treads the line of ambition and feasibility.
Throughout the year J.J and I organised weekly meetings in
which he provided invaluable feedback that led the project forward.
I also greatly appreciate his patience as I worked to
gain familiarity with a complex new area of computer science.

I would also like to thank my family for their support, and to my friends
with whom many fun times were had throughout my time in college.

I would like to thank Rory Egan, Dan Noonan and Kevin Moynihan with
whom I collaborated on a number of projects during the four-year course.
Their effort, talent, and insights made project work a painless task throughout
the years.

I would like to thank Dr. Jim Buckley for his work as FYP coordinator.
Finally, I would like to thank the CSIS faculty and staff who have all
contributed to a very positive four years of learning in this department. This
is especially the case for all the lectures and TAs that I have had over the
years who helped me develop a foundational CS knowledge that stood me in
good stead for this project.
